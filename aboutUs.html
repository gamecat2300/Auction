                                Jeff serves as the Executive Chairman for Auction.com, the country’s largest online real estate marketplace, which he co-founded in 2007 with long-time friend and business partner Rob Friedman. Under Jeff’s leadership, the company brings quality real estate assets to the market, makes prospective buyers aware of the properties through world-class marketing, and uses state-of-the-art technology to conduct transactions in a transparent online marketplace. In his role, Jeff has been responsible for translating the company’s conceptualized business vision into a successful reality.
                                <br/> <br/>
                                With his strong entrepreneurial spirit and a remarkable talent for driving sales and marketing, Jeff has steered the company to its position as the dominant player in residential and commercial real estate auctions. Auction.com has thrived during one of the most challenging real estate markets in US history. Over $32 billion in real estate has been sold on the Auction.com platform – 43,000 properties with a value of $7.1 billion in 2014 alone.
                                <br/> <br/>
                                Jeff has also led the company in its transition from a traditional auction company into a technology company leveraging its extensive real estate and auction expertise. He has built relationships with top tier investors such as Stone Point Capital, Starwood Capital and most recently Google Capital, which invested $50 million in Auction.com in early 2014.
                                <br/> <br/>
                                In June 2014, Jeff received the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year™ 2014 Orange County Region Award for Real Estate. Jeff is a lifelong native of Orange County, CA, and avid Anaheim Ducks fan.
